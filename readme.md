# queuesound

WoW Addon that replicates the retail sorting functionality for classic.

Adds a sort icon to your main bag that will sort your bags to my personal estimation of the Retail sorting order, as well as allowing you to click on bag icons to set sorting options for each bag (Quest, Consumables, Trade Goods & Equipment) that will then be sorted into that bag.

Profession & class bags (Quivers, herb bags, etc) are currently managed automatically and can not have categories set.

Haven't gotten the chance to test it with a warlock's soul shard bag, so please comment if it works or if there are any issues!
